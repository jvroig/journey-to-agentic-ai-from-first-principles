Find the passwords.txt file, somewhere inside the qwen_playground folder.
It will contain random passwords made up of english words.
For each password, determine if it references one of the following categories:
- person/people
- place
- thing
- other

Then, write new files inside the "processed" subdirectory":
- "person_passwords.txt" - if there are one or more passwords that belong to the person/people category
- "place_passwords.txt" - if there are one or more passwords that belong to the place category
- "thing_passwords.txt" - if there are one or more passwords that belong to the thing category
- "other_passwords.txt" - if there are one or more passwords that belong to the "other" category (i.e., does not fit with any of the earlier three categories)


When you are done, review each new file to ensure that you have successfully written them.

Rewrite files as needed (for example, if they are missing).
